# 0x01. Caching

The project involves designing and implementing various caching systems to enhance data retrieval performance. It includes creating different caching algorithms such as FIFO, LIFO, LRU, MRU, and LFU, and integrating them into a robust caching mechanism. The goal is to optimize data access speeds, manage cache storage efficiently, and understand the trade-offs between different caching strategies.
